	The official mascot of the Connected podcast, crocheted by wonderful listener
	<a href="https://www.instagram.com/adequatelyginger/">Ellen Durack</a>. Inspired by “<a

		>weird fish</a
	>”, there are five woollen Rickies in existence, each with a unique colour spike pattern and accessoires.

	<a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/349" target="_blank">Stephen</a> and Myke were the first to receive their’s
	(though Relay mod Kathy has the OG). <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/356" target="_blank">Myke’s</a> has two
	medals because he was HRH the Consolidated Champion at the time.

	However, Federico has had to wait a while for his. His Ricky has seen some things. Initially sent to Stephen for
	bundled shipping, it went on its way to Rome, Italy. Presumably due to the unknown worth of a Christmas card, it got
	lost in the mail. Later on, while Federico had now gained Chairmanship, he got a replacement Ricky, King Ricky with
	crown and all. Yet after many months, the lost Ricky arrived back at Stephen’s house in Memphis.
