<p>The official trophy of the Rickies, brought to live by passionate listener and Discord mod Matt VanOrmer.</p>
<p>
	Originally named the Rickies Trophy (Late 2021), the engraved, manually assembled, and hand-chiselled hardwooden
	base holds and eliminates several laser edged acrylic sheets. Different sheets hold location markers corresponding
	to the cross sections of the Connected globe “flight lines”, allowing for all Chairman combinations. The large city
	ring is for the Annual Chairman, while the smaller city ring is for the Keynote Chairman.

	how the Tricky came to be.
</p>
<p>
	This modular trophy allowed each host to have
	<a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/368" target="_blank">his own Tricky on their desk</a> without having to ship
	items after every scoring. They must simply update their Tricky to reflect the new winner when the scoring
	completes.
