<p>The Rickies are a prediction award show on the <a href="#">Connected</a> podcast on <a href="#">Relay FM</a>. Every year and every Apple event, Myke Hurley, Stephen Hackett, and Federico Viticci predict what Apple will announce next. Over the course of the show, the hosts have relied on <a href="#">The Bill of Rickies</a> to keep the record straight. Some predictions are risky, some are just to flex, most are formed with passion.</p>
