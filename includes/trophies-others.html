	Following the Rickies of WWDC 2020, the hosts concluded that
	<a href="/billof/keynote-jun-2020#rule69">amending the Bill of Rickies</a> with official Twitter accounts was the
	way to go. <a href="https://twitter.com/keynotechairman">@KeynoteChairman</a> and
	<a href="https://twitter.com/annualchairman">@AnnualChairman</a>, corresponding to the Chairman titles, were
	created, and login details have rotated with each transfer of power since. These social media accounts convey
	bragging rights while avoiding costly international shipping fees to pass around a physical trophy multiple times
	per year…

	Not a trophy but just for bragging rights, the winner of the Flexies gets to

	<a href="/billof/keynote-jun-2020#rule83">must then donate $25 per wrong Flexies</a> he made to the selected
	charity.

	Finally there’s the Passion Cup, the unofficial trophy I designed for <b>Rickies.co</b>. The high base raises the
	three golden hosts, together holding the Connected-coloured globe, with flight lines, above their heads.

<p>
	It was this original visual that triggered Matt in the Discord, highlighting a need for physical trophies and making
	the incredible Trickies. As for listeners, those that purchased a MagTricky received some Passion Cup stickers as
	well.
