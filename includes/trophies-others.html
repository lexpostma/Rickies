	<a href="/billof/keynote-jun-2020#rule69">amending the Bill of Rickies</a> with official Twitter accounts was the
	way to go. <a href="https://twitter.com/keynotechairman">@KeynoteChairman</a> and
	<a href="https://twitter.com/annualchairman">@AnnualChairman</a>, corresponding to the Chairman titles, were
	created, and login details have rotated with each transfer of power since. These social media accounts convey
	bragging rights while avoiding costly international shipping fees to pass around a physical trophy multiple times

	Finally there’s the Passion Cup, the unofficial trophy I designed for <b>Rickies.co</b>. It was this original visual
	that triggered Matt in the Discord, highlighting a need for physical trophies.
