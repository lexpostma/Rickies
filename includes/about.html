<p>
	Hi, I’m
	<a href="https://lexpostma.me" target="_blank" data-goatcounter-click="lexpostma.me" title="Visit Lex’ website"
		>Lex Postma</a
	>
	from The Netherlands. <b>Rickies.co</b> is my tribute to the Rickies prediction draft episodes of the
	<a

		target="_blank"
		data-goatcounter-click="relay.fm/connected"
		title="Visit Connected"
		>Connected podcast</a
	>. I’ve grown up with Relay FM shows (and their predecessors), they’ve shaped part of who I am. So I wanted to
	create something cool for Myke, Stephen, and Federico, to thank them for the many hours of fun I have had ‘with
	them’ over the years.
</p>
<p>
	As a designer I poured my heart into
	<a href="https://github.com/lexpostma/Rickies/blob/main/Details.md">the details</a> of this fun personal project. As
	an amateur web developer I learned many new skills while holding two hammers (PHP and Airtable) and seeing nails
	everywhere.

	<a href="#more_fan_efforts">Other fan efforts</a> have preceded, inspired and/or aided me in creating this site. The
	ever changing rules on The Bill of Rickies triggered me initially, and inspiration from Zach Knox’ interactive
	scorecards for the Upgrade Draft completed the concept. The result is <b>Rickies.co</b>, <i>my</i> take for
	<i>my</i> favourite show.
