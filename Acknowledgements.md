## Content

Obviously, 99% of the content on the website comes from the [Connected](https://relay.fm/connected) podcast on [Relay FM](https://relay.fm). The website is meant as a tribute to the great show that Federico Viticci, Myke Hurley, and Stephen Hackett have hosted for many years.

[Airtable](https://airtable.com) is used as the backend of this web application. All data and most images are managed and hosted there.
